# DinoRusher ðŸ¦–

Here you can find a remake of famous Chrome Dino game using an 8x8 matrix, 16x2 LCD display, a joystick and a buzzer.

In this game you are a T-Rex (or two dots in this scenario) who needs to avoid some random generated obstacles. To do so the player can jump 3 spaces or in worst case scenario can duck for a while.

How to play:
  -> Start the game
  -> Use joystick up or press joystick to jump
  -> Use joystick down to duck

If the difficulty is medium or hard the matrix gonna light up for a while, so be carrefour of changes.
